About me -

I'm Michael. I like JavaScript!

 I programmed either as a team member or alone and few times as a manager or instructor of another programmer or as a project designer. Two projects needed more capabilities than I had and have been passed to another programmer. All other times, I completed my work in time (in most cases).

A few times I requested professional help from my technical manager. I managed better when my technical boss was very bright and professional and we had a very good work relationship. I established an emotional bond with my colleagues. I managed my projects so that they usually worked without bugs. One project was sold to Alcatel, On another, I received a letter of praise from the manager of an unmanned reconnaissance department in IAI for my "diligence and capabilities."

When I made development tools for programmers as a "toolsmith,"  I listened to their needs and gave good service. I was successful when instructing colleagues in the field. During all my life I directed myself towards self learning of new domains and techniques and incorporating them in solving challenges of new projects.

Recently I have been focusing on Frontend, especially JavaScript, and I seek a job in JavaScript and/or ReactJS.
